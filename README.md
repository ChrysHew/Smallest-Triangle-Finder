# Smallest Triangle Finder

## Description

The Smallest Triangle Finder is a Java project that aims to find the smallest triangle, given a set of points in a two-dimensional plane. It utilizes computational geometry algorithms to determine the triangle with the smallest area among all possible triangles formed by the given points.

## Features

- Takes a set of points as input and computes the smallest triangle formed by those points.
- Supports both random points generation and manual input of points.
- Offers efficient algorithms for finding the smallest triangle by utilizing mathematical principles.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chryshew/smallest-triangle-finder.git
```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.

3. Build the project using the build tools provided by your IDE.

## Usage

1. Run the `Main` class to start the program.

2. Enter the points manually: enter the coordinates of each point.

4. After entering the points, the program will compute the smallest triangle.
